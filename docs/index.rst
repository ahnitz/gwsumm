The gravitational-wave summary information system
#################################################

The `gwsumm` package is a tool used by the `Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave
Observatory (LIGO) <http://www.ligo.org>`_ to collect, aggregate, and visually
summarise the myriad data produced throughout the experiment in order to
characterise instrument performance.

The output of this package, known internally as the 'summary pages', give an
archive of a number of figures or merit, including time-series amplitude
trends, frequency spectra and spectrograms, and transient event triggers.
